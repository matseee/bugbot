# bugbot
super simple robot build with a 3d printer, an arduino nano, serveral servos (6x Reely S-5252-030 and 6x Reely S-0008) and a pca9685 servo board. The robot is powered via an 6v nimh battery. The printed parts (directory `/cad` for the 3d project and directory `/stl` for the printable parts) where designed with the open source software [freecad](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD) and then printed with an anycubic i3 mega 3d printer. 

Its probably an attendee for r/shittyrobots/.

## thank you!
